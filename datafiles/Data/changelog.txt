Changes in v3.11.0 Beta 4 (2024.11.28):

* Fixed note panning taking the value of velocity when loading a song.
* The 'Check for development releases' is now enabled by default when installing
   a development release.



Changes in v3.11.0 Beta 3 (2024.11.28):

Additions:

* Added a new auto-recovery system which takes multiple open instances into
   account:
   * Songs with unsaved changes are saved to a backup directory every 10 minutes.
   * When NBS quits abnormally (due to a crash, power loss or system restart),
   you'll be prompted to recover the files the next time you open the program.
   * Clicking 'Yes' will copy the files to a restore directory so you can move them
   somewhere else.
   * Clicking 'No' will leave the unsaved files in the backup directory so you can
   recover them later.

* The fade in and fade out macros now work relatively to each note's velocity,
   multiplying it by the decay factor.
   * Previously, only the first note block in each selected column would be taken
   into account for determining all velocity values in that column.
   * Notes at each end of the selection will no longer go down to velocity 0, or
   into negative values.

* Blackout mode is now available in Player Mode, including the shortcut (F10)!

* Added a button to the greeting window to open Note Block World, our brand
   new website for browsing and sharing note block songs!

Bugfixes and improvements:

* The link for the OpenNBS QQ group will be displayed instead of Discord when
   the language is set to Chinese.
* Added a small banner to the greeting window which lets you buy us a coffee.
   Thank you!
* Macro windows are now closed immediately if no note blocks are selected,
   which should prevent certain softlock cases.
* Fixed auto-save ticking down into negative values and saving the song every
   frame once the timer reaches zero.
* Fixed opening songs with the nbs:// URL protocol not working in some cases.
* Fixed a crash when compressing a selection with some particular note
   arrangements.
* Loading and saving songs have been made much faster.
* Fixed the application name in Task Manager, Programs and Resources etc.
   being incorrectly set to a description.
* Fixed solo button states not moving together with the layers when adding a
   new layer above a solo layer.
* Fixed the volume slider number popup going past the intended range.
* Transparency effects are now disabled if setting them up failed in the last
   session.
* Fixed the piano keybind flashing faster while being edited according to your
   FPS setting.
* Reduced the maximum channel count with 'Use more audio channels' enabled
   from 32,768 to 1,024, the largest possible value.
* Removed the button to watch tutorial videos from the greeting window.
* Fixed offset of vertical bars (|) in the greeting window links while using the
   classic themes due to their wider font.
* Replaced the opennbs.org url with noteblock.studio.
* Updated credits in the About window.
