* Fix macro windows when nothing is selected.
* Fix auto-save countdown going into the negatives.
* Fix compressing selection sometimes crashes the editor.
* Fix missing notes after compressing selection.
* Revert Windows app description due to it displaying as the program name in
   Task Manager and Programs and Resources.

Changes in v3.11.0 Beta 1 (2024.07.09):

* Added a sound import assistant to help you use sounds from Minecraft: Java
   Edition in your songs!
    * Accessible from Settings > Import sounds from Minecraft.
    * Make sure to launch the version you want from the Launcher before
       importing its sounds. Set your Minecraft installation path and game version,
       click the button to get sounds and watch them magically appear!
    * The sounds from the selected version will be copied to the 'minecraft'
       folder in your Sounds folder.

* Note Block Studio now registers itself as a handler for the nbs:// URL
   protocol on startup.
    * This can be used to open NBS files from an external application, such as
       a blog or website.
    * By default, the program will launch in the player mode when handling the
       protocol.
    * To prevent security risks, the file won't be opened if it can't be
       detected as a valid song, or if it's over a certain size.

* It is now possible to save a song with its custom sound files attached.
    * Reach over to File > Save song with instruments... to find this option.
    * This makes sharing songs with custom instruments easier than ever!
    * The saved file is a regular ZIP file containing the song, as well as the
       sound files used in it.
    * This feature replaces the 'Export sounds' option, previously accessible
       from the Instruments window.

* Added Minecraft version setting to data pack export.
    * You can choose between 1.13-1.20 and 1.21+.
    * This was necessary due to a change in the internal structure of data
       packs, in order to not break compatibility with older versions.

* Added new OpenNBS social links to the greeting window, the Help menu and the
   About window.

* Added donation links! If Note Block Studio is useful to you and you'd like to
   support its development, feel free to check out these options.
